Although <br> all these components have an important weight in the <br> design, the colors we choose will have a direct impact <br> on how we convey emotions and ideas to the viewers.  </h3>
                <p class="paragraph"><a class="sansBold" href="https://www.albersfoundation.org/alberses/biography">Josef Albers </a>dedicated almost his entire career exploring the proposition <br> that the most important element in painting is color. 
                    In his work we can <br>see there is great depth of emotion and a good deal of psychology present. <br>He was mostly interested in the way colors interacted with each other, <br>and the effect that interaction had on human perception. One of the key <br>discoveries he made is that <span class="serifHighlight">human beings are easily susceptible to illusion,</span><br> and he dedicated himself to demonstrate this through his art.</p>

        <div class="thirdSection"> 
                <p class="paragraph2"> While teaching at Yale, Albers wrote a book called <a class="sansBold" href="https://interactionofcolor.com/?id=-21516">The Interaction of Color,</a> whiytch covered in exacting detail all of his discoveries about the way colors interacted with each other, how light affects hue, and how the “normal human eye” was not able to grasp certain color phenomena.
                <br><br>
                Albers’ teachings presented a direct observation on the behaviour of colour and he asserted that only by studying colour in context and <span class="serifHighlight">through the experience of trial and error, can one start to comprehend its true nature.</span>
                <br><br>
                He devoted 27 years of his life to creating a series of paintings called <a class="sansBold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpTr_BDVjFI">Homage <br>to the Square.</a> By using a single geometric form over and over, he was able to investigate the vast range of perceptual phenomena that could be achieved simply by juxtaposing various colors together within a limited range of spatial compositions.</p>

            <p class="paragraph2"> Thinking about brands, most of the time the way we recognize or remember them is because of the colors they have used to visualize and translate their identity.
                <br><br>
                Colors have the power to <span class="serifHighlight">make us feel in intensely emotional ways,</span> and <br>they can awaken distant memories inside of us. As <a class="sansBold" href="https://www.yvesklein.com/en/bio/">Yves Klein,</a> once said: <br><span class="serifHighlight">“All colors arouse specific associative ideas.”</span>
                <br><br>
                <a class="sansBold" href="https://www.instagram.com/raissa_pardini/?hl=es">Raissa Pardini,</a> a vidual designer who specializes in digital typography <br>and color says that when she first started to work with colors, she started <br>to notice things she didn’t before. Simple things such as the details of a <br>building or badly designed signs, which often have the best color pellete.</p>

        <div class="fifthSection"> 
            <p class="quote">“The emotions behind colors can be <br>a very personal thing, and there’s no single theory of color or recipe to <br>follow.” <br> <br><span class="quoteName">Raissa Pardini</span></p>

        <div class="sixthSection">
            <h2 class="bigQuote"> “There’s an instinct inside of us that leads us to pick certain colors,<br> but the more you work with color, the more those instincts sharpen.<br> The more you begin to understand how people react to colors.<br> What I’ve found is that experience is key.”<br> <br> <span class="quoteNameBig">Raissa Pardini </span></h2>
        </div>

        <div class="seventhSection"> 
            <p class="paragraph2"> Certain colors can stick in your mind if they’re used well, and when people remember a brand’s color palette, they instantly know who is speaking to them.
                <br><br>
                “Color is such an <span class="serifHighlight">important tool for capturing and opening up the personality of your brand to your audience,”</span> says Tristan. “Color is often about psychology and what people know about that color. Red, for instance, has a particular association. But then how you execute red can really vary and create different sorts of meanings.”
                <br><br>
                Raissa also explains that getting to know and understand your client is absolutely important for finding that right fit of colors, as well as research. <br><span class="serifHighlight">One color can have many different meanings,</span>and its crucial to research to <br>make sure it’s the right choice – culturally and historically speaking.
